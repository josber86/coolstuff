My name is Jose MOntes de Oca
This is where I am right now: 
I work for Financial Services firm and have worked there for the last 8 years. 
My work is very structured at this point which gives me time to develop myself outside the firm

I also have some future expectations: 
1) Become a serial entreprenurial
2) Get a PHd in Economics
